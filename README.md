SmallWorld
==========

Unfortunaly, I couldn't put a demo in place to demonstrate the work done.
I had to comment multiple classes in order for the application to compile due to work in progress.

Tasks done
----------

* The project layout containing the gdx library is ready
* A main screen menu displaying a welcome message is in place
* The camera scrolling and zooming is implemented for the game
* The physic engine is enabled with boundaries corresponding to the world boundaries
* It is possible to grab physical objects and move them around

Tasks in progress
-----------------

* The world environment (50%)
* The genetic algorithm (70%)

Remaining tasks
---------------

* Create the options menu to modify the environment
* Add assets for object in the world
* Add features for artificial creatures (for now the only one implemented is moving)
